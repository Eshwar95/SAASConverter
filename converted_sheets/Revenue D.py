# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>+<cell_ref>
Sure! Here's a Python method to convert the "=<cell_ref>+<cell_ref>" Excel formula template into Python code:

```python
def add_cells(cell_ref1, cell_ref2):
    return cell_ref1 + cell_ref2
```

This method takes two parameters, `cell_ref1` and `cell_ref2`, which represent the cell references in the Excel formula. The method simply adds the values of the two cell references and returns the result.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>*(1+1.5%)
Here are the Python methods to convert the provided Excel formula template into Python code:

Method 1:
```python
def calculate_formula(cell_ref):
    return cell_ref * (1 + 0.015)
```

Method 2:
```python
def calculate_formula(cell_ref, percentage):
    return cell_ref * (1 + percentage)
```

You can replace `<cell_ref>` with the actual cell reference and `<percentage>` with the desired percentage value when calling these methods in Python.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>*(1+1%)
Here's a Python method that converts the Excel formula template `=<cell_ref>*(1+1%)` into Python code:

```python
def convert_formula(cell_ref, percentage):
    result = cell_ref * (1 + percentage / 100)
    return result
```

In this method, `cell_ref` is the reference to the cell value that you want to multiply, and `percentage` is the percentage value you want to add. The method calculates the result by multiplying `cell_ref` with `1 + percentage / 100`.

You can call this method by passing the appropriate arguments:

```python
cell_value = 10
percentage_value = 1
result = convert_formula(cell_value, percentage_value)
print(result)
```

This will output the result of the formula calculation.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>*<cell_ref>
Sure! Here's a Python method that takes two cell references as parameters and returns the result of multiplying them:

```python
def multiply_cells(cell1, cell2):
    return cell1 * cell2
```

You can call this method by passing the cell references as arguments. For example, if you want to multiply the values in cell A1 and B2, you can do:

```python
result = multiply_cells(A1, B2)
```

Make sure to replace `A1` and `B2` with the actual cell references in your code.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>*(1+4.65%)
Here are the Python methods to convert the Excel formula templates into Python code:

Method 1: Convert Excel formula template to Python code with parameters

```python
def excel_formula_to_python(cell_ref, percentage):
    return cell_ref * (1 + percentage)
```

Method 2: Convert Excel formula template to Python code with parameters (using a class)

```python
class ExcelFormulas:
    @staticmethod
    def multiply_with_percentage(cell_ref, percentage):
        return cell_ref * (1 + percentage)
```

In both methods, the `cell_ref` parameter represents the cell reference (e.g., A1, B2, etc.), and the `percentage` parameter represents the percentage value to be added (e.g., 4.65%).

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>*(1+4.7%)
Here are the Python methods to convert the given Excel formula template into Python code with parameters:

Method 1: Using a single method to calculate the result for a given cell reference and interest rate.

```python
def calculate_result(cell_ref, interest_rate):
    return cell_ref * (1 + interest_rate / 100)
```

Method 2: Using two separate methods to calculate the result for a given cell reference and interest rate.

```python
def calculate_result(cell_ref):
    return cell_ref * (1 + 4.7 / 100)

def calculate_result_with_interest(cell_ref, interest_rate):
    return cell_ref * (1 + interest_rate / 100)
```

Please note that in the provided methods, `<cell_ref>` and `interest_rate` are the parameters that need to be passed while calling the methods.
