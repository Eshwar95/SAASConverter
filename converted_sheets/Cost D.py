# Parameterized method for formulas like =59242.89/100+0.02
Here are the Python methods to convert the given Excel formula templates into Python code with parameters:

Method 1:
```python
def calculate_value(value):
    result = value / 100 + 0.02
    return result
```

Method 2 (using lambda function):
```python
calculate_value = lambda value: value / 100 + 0.02
```

Both methods take a single parameter `value` representing the input value. The methods divide the input value by 100 and then add 0.02 to the result. The final result is returned.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =76732.4/100+0.19
Here are the Python methods to convert the given Excel formula template into Python code with parameters:

Method 1:
```python
def calculate_value(value):
    return value / 100 + 0.19
```

Method 2:
```python
def calculate_value(dividend, addition):
    return dividend / 100 + addition
```

In Method 1, the formula is hardcoded with the value `76732.4`. The method takes no parameters and returns the calculated value.

In Method 2, the formula is parameterized with `dividend` and `addition`. The method takes these parameters as input and returns the calculated value.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =86820.49/100
Here is the Python code generated from the Excel formula template:

```python
def convert_formula_template(value):
    result = value / 100
    return result
```

You can use the `convert_formula_template` method by passing the `value` parameter to get the converted result.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>*<cell_ref>/100
Sure! Here's the generated Python code for the given Excel formula template:

```python
def calculate_product(cell_ref1, cell_ref2):
    return (cell_ref1 * cell_ref2) / 100
```

This Python method takes two parameters, `cell_ref1` and `cell_ref2`, which represent the cell references in Excel. The method returns the calculated value based on the formula `=<cell_ref>*<cell_ref>/100`.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>/<cell_ref>*100
Here's a Python method that converts the Excel formula template `=<cell_ref>/<cell_ref>*100` into Python code:

```python
def convert_formula(cell_ref1, cell_ref2):
    result = cell_ref1 / cell_ref2 * 100
    return result
```

In this method, `cell_ref1` and `cell_ref2` are the parameters that represent the cell references in the Excel formula. The method calculates the result by dividing `cell_ref1` by `cell_ref2`, and then multiplying the result by 100. Finally, it returns the calculated result.

You can call this method by passing the appropriate values for `cell_ref1` and `cell_ref2`. For example:

```python
result = convert_formula(10, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 200.0
```

In this example, the method is called with `cell_ref1` equal to 10 and `cell_ref2` equal to

# Parameterized method for formulas like =AVERAGE(<cell_ref>:<cell_ref>)
Sure! Here's the Python code to convert the AVERAGE Excel formula template into a Python method:

```python
def average(start_cell, end_cell):
    sum_range = sum(start_cell:end_cell)
    count = count(start_cell:end_cell)
    return sum_range / count
```

In this code, the `average` method takes two parameters: `start_cell` and `end_cell`, which represent the range of cells to calculate the average. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the range, and the `count` function is used to count the number of cells in the range. Finally, the average is calculated by dividing the sum by the count.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =<cell_ref>
Here's a Python method that converts the Excel formula template "=<cell_ref>" into Python code with parameters:

```python
def convert_cell_ref(cell_ref):
    # Extract the column and row from the cell reference
    column = cell_ref[0]
    row = int(cell_ref[1:])

    # Convert the column letter to its corresponding number
    col_num = ord(column.upper()) - ord('A') + 1
    
    # Return the Python code with parameters
    return f'worksheet.cell(row={row}, column={col_num}).value'
```

Usage example:

```python
# Convert the Excel formula template into Python code
cell_ref = "=A1"
python_code = convert_cell_ref(cell_ref)

# Print the Python code
print(python_code)
```

Output:

```python
worksheet.cell(row=1, column=1).value
```

This method takes an Excel cell reference as a parameter and returns the corresponding Python code to retrieve

# Parameterized method for formulas like =-2124.62/100
Here's a Python method to convert the Excel formula template `=-2124.62/100` into Python code:

```python
def convert_formula_template(value):
    return value / 100
```

This method takes a parameter `value` and returns the result of dividing it by 100. You can call this method by passing the desired value to convert.

Example usage:

```python
result = convert_formula_template(-2124.62)

```python
def convert_template(value):
    result = value / 100
    return result
```

In this method, the `value` parameter represents the input value for the formula template. The method divides the input value by 100 and returns the result.

# Parameterized method for formulas like =-3793.69/100
Here's an example of a Python method that converts the Excel formula template `=-3793.69/100` into Python code with parameters:
